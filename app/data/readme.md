The inputs that were given to me by adventofcode aren't included (it's not mine to share, see https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying).

My input files are named:

- `day1.txt`  - Full input for day 1
- `day1-e1.txt` - First example input for me to use on day 1
- `day1-e2.txt` - Second example for day 1
-
- `day14.txt` - Full input for day 14
- `day14-e1.txt` - Example for day 14

The files just contain the input, and nothing more.
