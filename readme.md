This is my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) using Haskell.

I am using this to learn Haskell, do not take the code to be high quality or even fully functional. This code is shared mostly to let people see it if they are curious, and keep my GitHub somewhat alive, there are no guarentees that it functions properly and anything you run is at your own risk.

If you are brave and want to run the code, modify `app/Main.hs` to have `main = day {day number} {input number}` replacing `{day number}` with the number of the day to run, and `{input number}` with 0 for the full day's input, and another number for that number example. My inputs are in plaintext `.txt` files in `app/data/`; your input data may differ to mine. Then run `./brun` (build + run) and this will build the code, run it multithreaded (only affects day 12 at time of writing), and time how long running takes.

Have fun :)
