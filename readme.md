This is my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) using Haskell.

I am using this to learn Haskell, do not take the code to be high quality or even fully functional. This code is shared mostly to let people see it if they are curious, and keep my GitHub somewhat alive, there are no guarentees that it functions properly and anything you run is at your own risk.

Have fun :)
